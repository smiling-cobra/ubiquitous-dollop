# Comments

- In the second version of the assignment, I've noticed that there 16 and 15 (0 - 15) levels and I had to adjust the filter range accordingly. Given these changes, it's not possible to visualise filter according to the design mock ups.

- I decided to show generic error message for both endpoints failures because I was short in time.
